Mass drivers — electromagnetic catapults that accelerate payloads along a track
using coils or rails — have been a staple of space futurism since Gerard
O'Neill proposed them in the 1970s. They tend to get dismissed as impractical.
Let's steelman them.

## What is a mass driver?

A mass driver is a linear electromagnetic accelerator. Think of a coilgun
stretched out to kilometers in length. A payload (called a "bucket") rides along
a track, accelerated by sequential electromagnetic coils, until it reaches the
desired velocity and is released.

O'Neill's original concept was built for the Moon: a track tens of kilometers
long, accelerating payloads of lunar regolith to escape velocity and flinging
them toward L2 for collection and use in building space habitats.

## The strongest arguments

### 1. No propellant, ever

The single biggest advantage. A mass driver converts electricity into kinetic
energy. No combustion, no exhaust, no propellant logistics. Every launch has
roughly the same marginal cost: the electricity consumed.

On the Moon, with solar arrays or a nuclear reactor, this means **unlimited
launches** bounded only by energy supply and maintenance.

### 2. Arbitrarily high throughput

Chemical rockets are expensive one-shot devices. A mass driver is reusable
infrastructure. Once built, it can launch payloads continuously — one every few
minutes if the power supply supports it. O'Neill estimated throughputs of
hundreds of thousands of tonnes per year.

For bulk material transport (regolith, oxygen, metals), this throughput is
transformative.

### 3. The Moon is the right place

The lunar environment is almost purpose-built for mass drivers:

- **No atmosphere** — the payload doesn't need aerodynamic shaping or heat
  shielding during acceleration
- **Low escape velocity** — 2.4 km/s requires a manageable track length
- **Stable surface** — no weather, no erosion, no seismic activity (mostly)
- **Vacuum** — no energy lost to air resistance

A 10 km track at 3 g acceleration reaches 2.4 km/s. That's aggressive but
physically straightforward.

### 4. Proven physics

There's no new physics here. Linear electromagnetic accelerators exist today —
the U.S. Navy's EMALS catapult on the *Gerald R. Ford*-class carriers
accelerates 25-ton aircraft to 130 knots over 100 meters. Scaling up the
length while reducing the acceleration is an engineering problem, not a
research problem.

Railgun programs have demonstrated projectile velocities over 2 km/s in
laboratory settings. The physics works.

### 5. Synergy with ISRU

Mass drivers and in-situ resource utilization are natural partners. ISRU
produces bulk material (regolith, extracted metals, oxygen). Mass drivers are
optimized for launching bulk material cheaply. Together, they make the Moon an
exporter of construction material to cislunar space.

## The real objections

Steelmanning requires acknowledging the weaknesses:

**Power requirements.** Launching a 20 kg payload to 2.4 km/s requires about
57.6 MJ of kinetic energy. With realistic efficiency (say 50%), that's ~115 MJ
per launch. At one launch per minute, you need roughly 2 MW of continuous power.
That's a significant solar or nuclear installation.

**Track alignment and maintenance.** A multi-kilometer track on the lunar
surface must maintain precise alignment. Thermal cycling (250°C swings between
day and night) causes expansion and contraction. The track needs either active
alignment or thermal management.

**Aiming.** A mass driver gives you a fixed launch azimuth. You can vary
velocity and timing, but you can't easily change direction. This limits
trajectory flexibility compared to rockets.

**Fragile payloads.** At 3 g, you can launch raw materials and robust
equipment. You cannot launch people, delicate electronics (without hardening),
or pressurized containers without careful design.

## Comparison with tether catapults

| Property             | Mass driver          | Tether catapult     |
|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Moving parts         | Minimal (EM coils)   | Rotating cable      |
| Track length         | ~10 km               | ~1-5 km cable       |
| Power requirement    | High (pulsed)        | Moderate (continuous)|
| Payload flexibility  | Fixed azimuth        | Variable release    |
| Maintenance          | Track alignment      | Cable fatigue       |
| Technology readiness | Higher               | Lower               |

Both concepts solve the same problem — propellantless launch from a low-gravity
body — with different tradeoffs. Mass drivers win on technology readiness and
throughput. Tethers win on flexibility and potentially lower infrastructure mass.

## Why now?

The Artemis program and commercial lunar landers (SpaceX Starship HLS, Blue
Origin Blue Moon) are creating a sustained human presence on the Moon for the
first time. Once you have people and power on the surface, building
infrastructure like mass drivers becomes a question of priority, not
possibility.

The strongest version of the mass driver argument is this: if you're serious
about cislunar industrialization — building things in space from space
resources — then electromagnetic launch from the Moon is not optional. It's the
only known way to move thousands of tonnes per year off a planetary surface
without consuming propellant.

That's a hard argument to dismiss.
